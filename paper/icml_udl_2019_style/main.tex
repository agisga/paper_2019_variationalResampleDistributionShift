\begin{abstract}
A distribution shift based resampling framework is proposed to evaluate the robustness and generalization capability of deep learning models. Auto Encoder Variational Bayes is used to find a latent representation of the data, on which Variational Gaussian Mixture Model is used to artificially create the distribution shift by dividing the dataset into different clusters. Wasserstein distance is used to characterize the extent of distribution shift between train and test data. We compare several state of art deep learning models including AC-GAN, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network, and conventional CNN on the fashion-mnist dataset to assess their robustness under the artificially created distribution shift.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Deep Learning methods seems to be prone to corruptions and adversarial perturbations \cite{carlini2017towards}, which makes it challenging for real world applications. Distribution Shift \cite{wen2014robust} is another phenomena that can occur in practical deep learning scenarios especially medical machine learning field \cite{sun2019high}. 

Inspired from \cite{sun2019high}, we extend their work to image data and propose a resampling technique.
